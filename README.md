# C-Bot

NOTE: I did not write all of this code, this was a group project where 5 people contributed. I worked on portions of the program, mainly the
sound, sensor implementation, and some aspects of movement.

Code for a "bot" with a TI TM4C microprocessor, including cliff, sound, and IR sensors. The bot has both autonomous, as well as manual movement implemented.
The websocket portion was used with Putty.
